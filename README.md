# Jobportunities Software Architecture

A software design document that outlines the architecture for a concept of a system for a company that job seekers turn to for finding jobs. The system is supposed to ease the work of the company in question as well as facilitate finding jobs for job seekers. 

**The website was never developed as the main focus was to create an architecture only.**

The design of the forms in the document was created with [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html). 

*It is important to note that the design of the forms were not a high priority for this particular project as there were no real intentions to program and deploy the system.*
